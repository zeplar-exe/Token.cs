## Quirks and Miscellaneous Features

- Symbols are always parsed as single units. That is, a token containing more than one symbol will never be generated by
the tokenizer or lexer. The same goes for whitespace (CRLF is an exception).
- [LexerTokenType.AlphaNumeric](./Token.cs/LexerTokenType.cs#L16) will always contain alphabetical characters.
It may or may not contain numeric characters, and will never be purely numeric.
