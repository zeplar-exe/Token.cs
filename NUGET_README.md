# Token.cs (TokenCs)

![build](https://github.com/zeplar-exe/Token.cs/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)

A simple library to abstract the gritty process of lexical parsing.

## Installation

## Samples

For extended samples, see [/samples/](https://github.com/zeplar-exe/Token.cs/tree/master/samples) on GitHub.

## Quirks and Miscellaneous Features

- Symbols are always parsed as single units. That is, a token containing more than one symbol will never be generated by
  the tokenizer or lexer. The same goes for whitespace (CRLF is an exception).
- [LexerTokenType.AlphaNumeric](https://github.com/zeplar-exe/Token.cs/tree/master/Token.cs/LexerTokenType.cs#L16) will always contain alphabetical characters.
  It may or may not contain numeric characters, and will never be purely numeric.
- [LexerTokenType.Numeric](https://github.com/zeplar-exe/Token.cs/tree/master/Token.cs/LexerTokenType.cs#L20) can be any real number.
- For sanity checking, import `TokenCs.Extensions` for some useful extension methods regarding quirky token types.
